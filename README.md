# KrakenAPI
The plugin API for [Kraken](https://github.com/RSKraken). The plugin API is currently only being tested on Java 8. Another example plugin can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/RSKraken/f982e8be6a37a98e5b51689acbea1a20).

## Bootstrap
The entry-points for all plugins are always the static methods in `kraken/plugin/Entry`. You must compile the API into the plugin jar.
